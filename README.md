# 8086-Microprocessor-Based-Item-Management-System
A project to manage item data using the 8086 microprocessor. Tasks include sequential storage of item names and prices, sorting items by price using Bubble Sort, and searching for items priced above certain price using Binary Search. Outputs include sorted items with prices and relevant items from the search results.

Statement of the problem:   			
On a sunny day in 1980, you and your friend went to a store and bought n number of items for your friendâ€™s home. Returning home, your friend was expected to report the list of items and their prices in an ascending order. The catch was, no notepad was in hand. Fortunately, your friend had a programmable 8086 processor kit with him and the friendly shopkeeper, skilled in typing, agreed to help with data entry. So your friend asked you, an efficient coder, to write an assembly code so that the processor would ask the shopkeeper to enter the name of each item and its price.
Upon listing all items name and price, you noticed that the prices were entered in a scattered manner. Learning this issue your friend again asked you to write a sorting algorithm based on either bubble sort or quick sort you had learned in the school. 

Tasks:
1. Compose an assembly program that receives input for item names and corresponding prices sequentially, storing the information.
2. Write down an assembly program to arrange the prices in ascending order and display the complete list of items with their names and sorted prices.
3. Employ Binary Search Algorithm to find out all the items name with price more than 20$.
